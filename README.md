# Machine-Learning-Course-Foundation
In this course, I got hands-on experience with machine learning from a series of practical case-studies. I studied how to predict house prices based on
house-level features, analyze sentiment from user reviews, retrieve documents of interest, recommend products, and search for image s. It basically
divides machine learning into categories like regression, classification, clustering, retrieval, recommender systems, and deep learning and explores each
one of them separately. Through hands-on practice with these use cases I would be able to apply machine learning methods in a wide range of
domains.
